What exactly is Photoelectric effect, and how was it discovered? 
When light or other radiation hits material it transfers it's energy directly to it. If electron inside material
receives more energy than the one which binds it to atom's core it can escape material. Electrons which left
material this way, are called photoelectrons. Whole idea of how photoelectric effect works is described by
quantum mechanics. First explanation of the effect was proposed by Einstein in 1905. His work was the foundation
of determining the dualistic nature of photon, and concept of packets of energy. 
The phenomenon can be described:

h * v = W + E
where:
h- Planck's constant
v-frequency of photon
W-work function of material 
E- maximum energy of emitted electrons

Our program can show user how (conceptually) free electrons leave material. The user can work with following fixed
materials, with known work function:

Magnesium: 3,66 eV
Silver: 4,7 eV
Cesium: 2,14 eV
Gold: 5,47 eV 

As was mentioned before, the phenomenon will occure only if energy of photon will be great enough to break 
binding forces of electron however the user can enter any frequency. 

Photoelectric effect is used by modern technology in many ways. One, for example is in photography, in image sensors.
